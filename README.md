# One-FIle-Programs
A collection of useful programs that are only contained by one text file.

This Repository is a collection of programs that I wrote that were parts of developing other random projects. These one file programs I see the potential of being used in other places and in that way they are powerful. This folder is also a hodgepodge of programs with no better place to house than this.
